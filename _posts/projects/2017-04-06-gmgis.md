I finally got around to make a platform where I can try different things. I wanted to have a place where I could dump small projects and a platform to learn new things. I used Jekyll for template-ing and Vue.js because I wanted to try it. I try to keep the site as small as possible so all the images are SVG stripped of any metadata. I'll keep any TODO's, tips, and thanks on a separate site.
