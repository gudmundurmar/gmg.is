I finally got around to make a platform where I can try different things. I wanted to have a place where I could dump small projects and a platform to learn new things. I used Jekyll for template-ing and Vue.js because I wanted to try it. I try to keep the site as small as possible so all the images are SVG stripped of any metadata. I wrote bit about [how to make this site](/making-a-site) if you want to get started on your own.
