Sometimes I make a little music. I've played the piano since I was young. I also studied electronic music (where I made these songs), and the organ for a few years later in life. If you're interested I did make my own rendition of ["Don't stop believing" for organ (PDF)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7i96cnaz7m788mb/Dont%20Stop%20-%20.pdf). The songs below vary quite a bit. Ranging from a movie score (Innrás) to a song made entirely from the sounds in an interview from 1967 (Sæból 1967 Remix). Maybe I'll some more things I've made, but while we wait for that feel free to listen.
