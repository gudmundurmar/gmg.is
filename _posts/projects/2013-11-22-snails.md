Remember Worms... [Snails, Operation Nightfall](https://gudmundurmar.github.io/Snails/) is a minature version made entirely with Vanilla Javascript. There are four levels and nine weapons to choose from. So pick a level and grab a friend. It's time to play.

The game was programmed in 3 weeks (1 Nov - 22 Nov 2013) by four software engineering students at the University of Iceland.
