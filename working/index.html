      <h1>Levo, co-founder</h1>
      <h2>2014-current</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="Working__jobDescription">In 2014 I co-founded a company called Levo with a couple of friends and we were one of ten companies selected for <a href="//startupreykjavik.is" target="_blank">Startup Reykjavík</a> in 2014.  Levo's goal is to allow doctors to control images in the operating room themselves. Images are often projected onto a screen in an operating room where scrubbed in personel can neither touch nor move anything that has not been sterilized. Enabling quick access to vital information when needed without intermediaries can prevent and minimize risk of errors. We have been working with Landspítalinn (the National hospital in Iceland) and they are currently using our solution. I mostly worked on this as a side-project, but recently allocated more time to this project.</p>

    <p class="Working__jobDescription">At Dohop (<a href="//dohop.com" target="_blank">www.dohop.com</a>) I helped launch a full rewrite of their site. Switching out a Django based site to a ReactJS, where we used Redux for state control, BEM (Block-element-module) for CSS scoping. Also wrote the apps for the original apps for them in React Native when it was bleeding edge (if we ran into problems we'd wait a week for a solution to appear). I also worked a bit in Python, did a lot of refactoring for old Django systems, and organized Dohop's first hackathon. You can see <a href="https://youtu.be/fWGVMPlg3LA?t=18m19s">my talk on Dohop's hackathon</a> at QuizUp headquarters in 2015.</p>

      <h3>(and other work with kids)</h3>
    </div>
    <p class="Working__jobDescription">I've worked quite a bit with children. I worked two summers at a preschool, two summers at an outdoor camp in the mountains of North Carolina, and been a soccer coach for 5 - 7 olds at Breiðablik. I've been the longest at Breiðablik's sports school (<a href="http://www.breidablik.is/um_breidablik/ithrottaskoli_breidabliks/">Íþróttaskóli Breiðabliks</a>) or for at least 9 years, 2007-2016. Parents bring their children, age 3-5, on Saturday mornings to take part in various athletics focusing on fine and gross motor-performance and group activites. These groups range from 40-80 children every morning. A few people (sometimes only two, but usually around four) would have half an hour set up a new obstacle course using the same things every week. I like the challenge of coming up with activities on the fly, but most importantly introducing kids to the excersize the gym in a welcoming manner and providing a platform for parents to spend time with them.</p>

      In 2012 I administered open study sessions once a week for first year engineering students at the University of Iceland. Students could ask about Physics I, Calculus I, and/or Linear algebra I.
      In 2014 I taught 80 minute, weekly classes at the University. Grading weekly assignments, and providing individual instructions as necessary.
