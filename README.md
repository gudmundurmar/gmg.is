# GMG.is

This is my personal site that I set up 

# Set up
1. To run have Jekyll set up.
2. You'll need to run `gem install bundler` and then `bundle install` for the live reload, [jekyll-feed](https://help.github.com/articles/sitemaps-for-github-pages/), and [jekyll-sitemap](https://help.github.com/articles/sitemaps-for-github-pages/) to work.

# How to run
- It runs just like any other Jekyll site with `jekyll serve`
- To run project with live reload just type `jekyll serve -L --watch`

# How I made it
I set up a small tutorial on how to get started with your own site.
