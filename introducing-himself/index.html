  <h1 class="About__title">Hi, I'm Guðmundur Már (or GMG)</h1>
  <p>If letters in your name aren't in the English alphabet... Does your name change? Or do you have two names?</p>

      <p>
        Like many other names the spelling changes when it leaves the country. It's written Gudmundur Mar in countries outside of Iceland since the Icelandic letter 'ð' (pronounced with a 'th' sound) is only available in the Icelandic alphabet. The same goes of for the á (pronounced 'aoo') even though it's available in a few more alphabets it might have a different pronuciation (so it's not worth the fuss keeping it there)

      <p>
        The Icelandic pronunciation of the name is something like, Gvuth-muhn-duhr Mow-r, with rolling r's. Different spelling changes the pronunciation entirely so I've just introduced myself exactly like it's written outside of Iceland (Good-muhn-dur Mar). Whether the pronounciation is correct or not is really just based on my opinion since it's originally wrong anyway.

      <p>
        I use the handle gudmundurmar online when GMG is not available. Otherwise I'm quite fond of GMG since I've never really taken to a nickname. In Icelandic GMG is actually the equivalent of OMG in English.
