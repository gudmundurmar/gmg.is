  content: I studied Software Engineering at the University of Iceland from fall of 2011 until spring of 2014. Alongside my studies, I worked as a teaching assistant, leading open study classes for first year engineering students in Physics I, Calculus I, and/or Linear Algebra I. Later, I taught an introductory course in User Designing Systems.

As a frontend engineer, I've been working with Javascript (Babel, React, React Native, etc.) and Python (Django, PyQt).

  content: Playing soccer is one of my favorite hobbies. I played in a League until I was around nineteen, when my ankle injuries required me to scale back. Focusing on my university studies provided some much needed rest. I enjoy playing occasionally now when I have the chance.

- title: Social

  content: I am quite a social person, and like working with others. In high school, I was on the sports commitee, elected class president, volunteered for redcross multicultural youth square, and worked quite a lot with kids. I worked at a preschool, coached soccer, and facilitated a Saturday morning sports school for kids and their parents. Recently, I've been active in the Javascript community in Iceland and joined them at JSconf in Iceland in 2016. I'm currently looking for opportunities to give back, whether it be reproductive rights, education, immigration rights, or something else, I am excited to use my skills to help others.
