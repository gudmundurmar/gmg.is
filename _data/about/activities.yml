As a frontend engineer I've been working with Javascript (Babel, React, React Native, etc.) and Python (Django, PyQt). I give a more detailed description on my work on <a href="/working">my resum√© page</a>.

  content: I played piano since I was seven. I really enjoy relaxing and improvising because it's whatever you want it to be. I sometimes record and studied studio recording and electrical music for a few years alongside studying the organ.

  content: I played soccer since around the same time as I started music. I played until I was around nineteen at which time ankle injuries had really given away. Focusing on my university studies provided some much needed rest. I enjoy playing occasionally now when I have the chance.

- title: Social

  content: I am quite a social person, and like working with others. I was on the sports commitee and class president in senior year in high school, volunteered for redcross multicultural youth square, and worked quite a lot with kids. Working at a preschool, coaching soccer, and facilitating a Saturday morning sports school for kids and their parents for nine years to name a few things. Recently I've been active in the Javascript community in Iceland and joined them at JSconf in Iceland in 2016. I'm currently looking for opportunities to give back. Whether it be reproductive rights, kids education, immigration, or something else, suggestions are welcome.
