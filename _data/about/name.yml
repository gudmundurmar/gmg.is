  content: Outside of Iceland my name loses its Icelandic letters and becomes Gudmundur Mar.<br> The letters "รฐ" (pronounced with a "th" sound, and "รก" pronounced like "ou" in ouch) don't get to follow me around the world.

  content: In Icelandic, it sounds something like "Gvuth-muhn-duhr Mow-r" with rolling r's. <br> Outside of Iceland I've just introduced myself exactly like it's written (Good-muhn-dur Mar). 

- title: Handle
  icon: fa-at
  content: I use two handles online, GMG or gudmundurmar. I'm quite fond of GMG since I've never really taken to a nickname, and those are quite common in Iceland. In Icelandic, GMG translates to the equivilant of OMG in English.
