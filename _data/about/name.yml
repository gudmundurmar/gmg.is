  content: Outside of Iceland my name loses its Icelandic letters and becomes Gudmundur Mar.<br> The letters "รฐ" (pronounced with a "th" sound) and "รก" (pronounced like "ou" in ouch) don't get to follow me around the world unfortunately.

  content: In Icelandic it sounds something like "Gvuth-muhn-duhr Mow-r" with rolling r's. <br> Outside of Iceland I've just introduced myself exactly like it's written there (Good-muhn-dur Mar). Whether the pronounciation is correct or not is really just my opinion.

  content: I use the handle gudmundurmar online when GMG is not available. Otherwise I'm quite fond of GMG since I've never really taken to a nickname. In Icelandic GMG is actually the equivalent of OMG in English.
