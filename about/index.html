          Hi there, I'm Guðmundur Már (or GMG)

            <p>
              Like many other names the spelling changes when it leaves the country. It's written Gudmundur Mar in countries outside of Iceland since the Icelandic letter 'ð' (pronounced with a 'th' sound) is only available in the Icelandic alphabet. The same goes of for the á (pronounced 'aoo') even though it's available in a few more alphabets it might have a different pronuciation (so it's not worth the fuss keeping it there)

            <p>
              The Icelandic pronunciation of the name is something like, Gvuhth-muhn-duhr Mouw-r, with rolling r's. Different spelling changes the pronunciation entirely so I've just introduced myself exactly like it's written outside of Iceland (Good-muhn-dur Mar). Whether the pronounciation is correct or not is really just based on my opinion since it's originally wrong anyway.

              I use the handle gudmundurmar online when GMG is not available. In Icelandic GMG is short for OMG. <a href="about">Read more about my life...</a>
